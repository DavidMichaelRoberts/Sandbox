== The twisted cocycle for M_16

Let V = {000, 100, 010, 110, 001, 101, 011, 111} be the elementary group 2^3, with addition mod 2 in each slot.

This file describes the twisted cocycle mu that gives the Moufang loop M_16(C_2 x C_4) as an extension of V by Z/2 from Theorem 2 of [1]

The function mu: V x V -> Z/2={0,1} is defined by

00000000
00001111
00001111
00001111
00000000
00111100
01011010
01101001

and is given in Example 1 of [2].
